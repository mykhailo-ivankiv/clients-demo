# Clients demo

This is a demo app to show some UI/UX approaches for a client list.
In this demo, I have tried to implement a lot of invisible features that are not visible to the user at first glance, but show themselves when you start using application.

Seme of the features are:
- fast
- works without js
- search by any field
- combining "AND" and "OR" search queries
- search highlighting

# Setup
@todo: add setup instructions

# Deployment
I use fly.io for deployment. It's a great service that allows you to deploy your app in seconds. You can find more information about it [here](https://fly.io/)
